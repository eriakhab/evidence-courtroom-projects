## About The Evidence Courtroom

The Evidence Courtroom presents scientific and analytical findings in a
courtroom-style format. Claims are examined, evidence is presented, limitations
are addressed, and conclusions are grounded in transparent analysis.

The project’s goal is to make complex research accessible to broader audiences
without compromising analytical integrity or scientific standards.
