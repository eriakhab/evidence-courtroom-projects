## About The Evidence Courtroom

The Evidence Courtroom is a research communication initiative that presents scientific and analytical findings in a courtroom-style format. Claims are examined, evidence is presented, limitations are addressed, and conclusions are grounded in data.

The project’s goal is to make complex research accessible to broader audiences without compromising analytical integrity or scientific standards.
