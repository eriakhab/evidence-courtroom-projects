# Episode 03 — Data Documentation

This folder contains the primary datasets and derived outputs used in
Episode 03: *The People vs. the Quality of Life Scale*.

The data support psychometric evaluation of a quality-of-life instrument
administered to hypertensive patients.

---

## Data Description

The primary dataset includes:

- Patient-reported quality-of-life responses
- Demographic characteristics
- Clinical indicators related to hypertension
- Scale item responses used for CFA and IRT modeling

These data were used to assess:

- Construct validity
- Item functioning
- Measurement invariance
- Reliability and scale performance

---

## Sample Characteristics

The analytical sample consists of adult patients diagnosed with
hypertension who completed the quality-of-life instrument.

Key characteristics include:

- Mixed sex and racial composition
- Variation in clinical status
- Complete and partially observed responses

Detailed sample summaries are reported in the analysis documentation.

---

## Missing Data Handling

Missing responses were addressed using:

- Full Information Maximum Likelihood (FIML)
- WLSMV estimation for categorical indicators

These approaches allow valid inference under missing-at-random
assumptions and are documented in the analysis scripts.

## File Contents

This folder may include:

### Datasets
- Raw or cleaned survey datasets
- Processed analysis-ready datasets
- Derived scale scores

### Analytical Outputs
- Result tables
- Model summaries
- Parameter estimates

### Visualization Files
- Plot files (e.g., `.xlsx` or similar formats)
