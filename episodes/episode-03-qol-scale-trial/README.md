# Episode 03 — The People vs. the Quality of Life Scale

## Hypertensive Patients and Measurement Validity

This episode examines whether a widely used quality-of-life instrument
accurately and fairly measures patient outcomes among individuals
with hypertension.

Using confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory,
and measurement invariance testing, this project evaluates:

- Construct validity
- Measurement bias
- Cross-group comparability
- Practical interpretability

## Folder Structure

- `data/` — Primary datasets  
- `analysis/` — Statistical scripts and documentation  
- `writeups/` — Technical and interpretive outputs  

---

## Reproducibility

All reported findings are derived from:

- Materials in `data/`
- Scripts in `analysis/`

This ensures transparency and reproducibility.

## Status

In development.
