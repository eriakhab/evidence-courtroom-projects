# Episode 03 — The People vs. the Quality of Life Scale

## Hypertensive Patients and Measurement Validity

This episode examines whether a widely used quality-of-life instrument
accurately and equitably measures patient-reported outcomes among
individuals with hypertension.

Using confirmatory factor analysis, item response theory,
and measurement invariance testing, this project evaluates:

- Construct validity
- Measurement bias
- Cross-group comparability
- Practical interpretability
