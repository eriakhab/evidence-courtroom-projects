# Episode 03 — Technical and Interpretive Writeups

This folder contains written materials supporting
Episode 03: *The People vs. the Quality of Life Scale*.

The documents in this directory translate statistical findings into
clear methodological, clinical, and interpretive narratives.

They are intended to support both technical review and public-facing
communication.

## Purpose

The writeups serve three primary functions:

1. Document analytical decisions and modeling strategy
2. Interpret statistical results in applied context
3. Communicate implications for patients, clinicians, and researchers

These materials bridge formal psychometric analysis and accessible
evidence-based storytelling.
